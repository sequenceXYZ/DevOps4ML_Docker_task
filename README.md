### DevOps4ML_Docker_task

#### Hands on task
As a junior DevOps Engineer, you need to create a docker image that will run apache web server to show a simple business card. 

Please use AWS Account and t2.micro instance for this task.

- A client wants to use a non-default port 15100 for HTTP
- No one should be able to connect to the host instance by SSH
- Apache must only be available for one public IP address
- Apache server must be the latest but should stay on the same version in future, even after redeployment
